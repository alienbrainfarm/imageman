feat: Add filename display toggle and video slideshow creation

This commit introduces two new features:

1.  **Toggle Filename Display:**
    *   Adds a "Show Filenames" option under the "Config" menu.
    *   Allows users to toggle the visibility of image filenames in both single image view and thumbnail view.
    *   The setting persists across application restarts via the Windows Registry.

2.  **Create Slideshow Video:**
    *   Adds a "Create Slideshow Video..." option under the "File" menu.
    *   Generates an MP4 video slideshow from all images in the current directory.
    *   Images are resized to HD (1920x1080) while maintaining aspect ratio, with black borders filling any empty space.
    *   The slideshow duration per image is configurable via the existing slideshow duration setting.
    *   Users can specify a minimum video length in minutes, and the slideshow will loop if necessary to meet this duration.
    *   A temporary directory is used for processed images and is automatically cleaned up after video creation.
    *   The MP4 video is saved in the current image directory.

**Technical Changes:**
*   Updated `requirements.txt` to include `Pillow` and `moviepy`.
*   Modified `start_imageman.bat` to ensure correct virtual environment activation and application launch.
*   Adjusted `imageman/main.py` to add the project root to `sys.path` for reliable module imports.
*   Corrected `moviepy` import path in `imageman/image_man_window.py`.
