feat: Implement MP4 creation using OpenCV

Replaced MoviePy with OpenCV (cv2) for video processing, including:
- Generating video thumbnails.
- Creating slideshow videos.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to reflect the dependency change.
- Modified `imageman/image_man_window.py` and `imageman/widgets.py` to integrate OpenCV.
- Added new test images and updated `tests/test_main.py` to include a test for video creation.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` and `build_portable.bat` for consistency.
